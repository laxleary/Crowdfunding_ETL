# Crowdfunding ETL
## Mini ETL Project

### Overview
In this repository, we first extract data from an excel sheet in the [Jupyter file](ETL_Mini_Project_AKarandikar_ALeary_AMashaly.ipynb), where we also clean the data and organize its relevant components into multiple data frames. We then export these data frames as CSVs. We develeoped an ERD for these CSVs in QuickDBD. Then, in the [SQL file](crowdfunding_db_schema.sql), we create an SQL database and use PostgresAdmin to import the csvs as tables, running queries to check that our databases are created appropriately. 

### Outside Sources
The following code was developed solely by the authors named on the challenge file, using class activities as references. No outside sources were consulted, including TAs, tutors, instructors, classmates, or the internet.
